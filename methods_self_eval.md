# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
I'm proud of the amount of effort and time (aka productive struggle) I've put into this assignment. I've taken breaks when I've needed to and then gotten back down to work.
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
Using methods simplifies the process of what the code is being asked to return by sticking to standardized categories that work the same every time.
